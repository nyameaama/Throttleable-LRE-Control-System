# Throttleable-LRE-System-Transfer-Function

Description of Closed Loop Control System for a Throttle-able LRE.


Engine System is based on Rocket Labs Electric Pump Feed Cycle which uses a solar powered power powering an Electric Motor which in turns powers the Fuel and Oxidizer Pumps pushing propellant into the combustion chamber. 









By varying the power to Fuel and Oxidizer Pumps, the pumps are supplied less power and this reduces the mass flow going into the main combustion chamber.
