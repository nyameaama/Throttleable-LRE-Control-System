An electrical current is regulated and passed through a solenoid coil creating and electromagnetic field. This field is used to control the valve.
When current flows through the coil, a magnetic field forms around the coil. The magnetic field attracts the armature toward the center of the coil. As the armature moves upward, the spring collapses and the valve opens. When the circuit is opened and current stops flowing to the coil, the magnetic field collapses. This allows the spring to expand and shut the valve.

Purpose:

My main aim for the Electro-Actuated Solenoid Valve is to theorize the use on the valve to move and regulate propellant flow through plumbing systems in a space vehicle
