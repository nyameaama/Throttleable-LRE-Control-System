<b><ul>Description of Open Loop Control System for a Throttle-able LRE.</b></ul>


[Engine System](https://github.com/nyameaama/Throttleable-LRE-System-Transfer-Function/blob/master/assets/LRE%20Plant.png) is based on Rocket Labs Electric Pump Feed Cycle [Rutherford Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Lab_Rutherford) which uses a solar to power an Electric Motor which in turns powers the Fuel and Oxidizer Pumps pushing propellant into the combustion chamber.

The LRE can be throttled by controlling the propellant combustion rate (usually measured in kg/s or lb/s). By changing the propellant valves open margin this causes a reduction in the mass flow going into the main combustion chamber.
